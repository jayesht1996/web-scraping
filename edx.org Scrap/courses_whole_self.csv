Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation. 

We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.

This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. 

The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.
What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?
Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations.

The open-source programming language R has for a long time been popular (particularly in academia) for data processing and statistical analysis. Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.",4/5,1 Reviews,Seth Mottaghinejad,"Data Scientist

All over the global market there are ledgers that organizations and individuals alike must trust. Blockchain technologies record promises, trades, transactions or simply items we never want to disappear, allowing everyone in an ecosystem to keep a copy of the common system of record.

This introductory course is carefully curated for both nontechnical and technical audiences. It examines blockchains for the enterprise and a number of pertinent use cases from Hyperledger, a global cross-industry community of communities hosted by The Linux Foundation and advancing business blockchain technologies. Hyperledger is incubating and promoting enterprise grade, open source business blockchain software, on top of which anyone can set up apps to meet cross-industry needs.

The course covers key features of blockchain technologies and the differentiators between various types of Hyperledger projects. We'll start with ‘what is blockchain’ and open the discussion to identifying suitable blockchain use cases for your business requirements. We will then take a deep dive into the enterprise-ready Hyperledger blockchain frameworks by guiding students through implementation of various blockchains.   

Students with a technical background will learn how to perform clean installations of Hyperledger Sawtooth and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as develop simple applications on top of these frameworks. 

Students with a business background will gain an understanding of how blockchains work and how they can create value for their business through cost-savings and efficiencies, in terms of speed and simplicity. They will view how information is generated, stored, and shared in various blockchains, as well as gain tools to evaluate whether or not a blockchain solution would be suitable for their particular business case.

Industries today are using blockchain technologies to increase efficiency and solve business problems associated with data privacy, security, information sharing, and inclusion.

As need for humanitarian aid grows, how can efforts to alleviate human suffering evolve with it?
This course from the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and HarvardX seeks to prepare learners to recognize and analyze emerging challenges in the humanitarian field. The course explores the ethical and professional principles that guide humanitarian response to conflict and disaster. Participants will learn the legal and historical frameworks that shaped these principles, test their applicability to the challenges faced by humanitarian actors today.
Through four case studies covering the responses to crises in Goma (Zaire), Somalia, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Pakistan, participants will engage with Harvard faculty, current practitioners, and one another.

En los últimos cinco años, ONGs y OSCs sin fines de lucro han tenido un rol prominente en el mundo en desarrollo, diseñando, implementando y evaluando proyectos con un gran impacto social. Sus intervenciones han alcanzado áreas que habían quedado desatendidas por otras organizaciones y, debido a su enfoque, su involucramiento en el desarrollo se ha incrementado exponencialmente en los últimos años. América Latina y el Caribe es una de las regiones que más se ha beneficiado de su contribución y se espera que la intervención de estas organizaciones siga fortaleciendo, junto con otros actores clave, el progreso económico y social de la Región.

Este curso presenta conceptos y herramientas que pueden ser aplicados en la gestión de proyectos y que pueden generar un cambio sustancial para alcanzar los objetivos propuestos con limitados recursos. De esta manera, este MOOC se propone fortalecer la capacidad de gestión de proyectos de ONGs y OSCs sin fines de lucro para que sean ejecutados en forma eficiente y efectiva.

El contenido general está basado en el MOOC “Gestión de proyectos de desarrollo” diseñado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y fue adaptado por el Project Management Institute Educational Foundation (PMI-EF) y el BID , con el fin de focalizar los conceptos y herramientas de gestión de proyectos al contexto de ONGs y OSCs sin fines de lucro por medio de un caso práctico transversal al curso, presentaciones por parte de expertos certificados Project Management Professional (PMP)® con amplia experiencia en el tema, foros de discusión y lecturas seleccionadas.

They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.

The first part of this course is comprised of five lessons that introduce the theory of causal diagrams and describe its applications to causal inference. The fifth lesson provides a simple graphical description of the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment in the presence of time-varying covariates. The second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the health and social sciences.

Cities, nations, and empires from antiquity through the middle ages drew on foundational histories and myths for their identities, relating these narratives through generations by means of oral-storytelling and new writing technologies. These epics, story collections, and novels, which take a keen interest in heroic travelers, would eventually travel themselves, finding new global audiences as the first works of world literature.

Tracing developments in language, writing, and literary genre, this course also travels in time, from legendary accounts of ancient kings to histories of medieval courts and early-modern exploration.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.

This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.

While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.

This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.

You will examine Japanese history in a new way—through the images created by those who were there—and the skills and questions involved in reading history through images in the digital format. The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.
Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?
Module 1: Black Ships & Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.
Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive ""Hibiya Riot"" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of ""imperial democracy"" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.
Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido & Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.

Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.

Un espacio en el que su monarquía creó el primer imperio global de la Historia. Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.

Aunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.

Esta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.

La acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.

En nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor.
Adentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura.
Ofrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él.
Comparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana.

The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.

By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.

Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.

Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field.

A quoi servent nos poumons ? Quel est le lien entre l’oxygène et la vie ? Ces questions ouvrent un vaste champ de découvertes et de curiosités pour mieux comprendre la  respiration. Ce cours s’adresse à toute personne qui souhaite apprivoiser, s’approprier ou approfondir le fonctionnement de la respiration et des poumons, autrement dit la physiologie respiratoire humaine.
 
Plongés au cœur de l’université et de la pratique hospitalière, durant  sept semaines, vous côtoierez professeurs, professionnels de la santé, internes et étudiants de médecine. Vous y apprendrez des notions de niveau universitaire qui ont été sélectionnées et adaptées afin que toute personne intéressée puisse les comprendre et y donner du sens. Ainsi, nous aborderons des thèmes proches du monde qui vous entoure : la respiration lors d’un effort physique, en altitude, le rôle des polluants atmosphériques, l’asthme….
 
A chaque leçon, un expert abordera des domaines concrets et pratiques : comment apprécier l’oxygénation d’un patient, pourquoi lui administrer de l’oxygène, que signifie hyperventiler….
 
Ce cours vous fera entrer en profondeur dans un monde où l’atmosphère est faite d’anatomie humaine, de physique des volumes et des pressions, de gaz et de sang, d’oxygène et de CO2, de poumons et de tissus, de tabagisme et de bronchite chronique.
 
Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capables de
expliquer et décrire les principes d’oxygénation, de ventilation, de transport et de consommation d’oxygène, de diffusion de gaz entre l’air et le sang… par des schémas et par des calculs utilisant quelques formules fondamentales.
évaluer la quantité et la qualité de l’oxygénation d’un patient,

Learners will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how people in Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and the ways that Shakespeare’s Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. Learners will also be invited to share their own theatrical interpretations of Hamlet and to consider how the themes of death, mourning, and memory shape Shakespeare’s play as well as their own lives.

You see them every day: on clocks, in the stock market, in sports, and all over the news. Algebra is all about figuring out the numbers you don't see. You might know how fast you can throw a ball, but can you use this number to determine how far you can throw it? You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you!

Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.

6.341x is designed to provide both an in-depth and an intuitive understanding of the theory behind modern discrete-time signal processing systems and applications. The course begins with a review and extension of the basics of signal processing including a discussion of group delay and minimum-phase systems, and the use of discrete-time (DT) systems for processing of continuous-time (CT) signals. The course develops flow-graph and block diagram structures including lattice filters for implementing DT systems, and techniques for the design of DT filters. Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding.

The practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before.
Learn about the variety of subtopics in topological materials, their relation to each other and to the general principles.
Learn to follow active research on topology, and critically understand it on your own.
Acquire skills required to engage in research on your own, and to minimize confusion that often arises even among experienced researchers.
Applications of topology in condensed matter based on bulk-edge correspondence.
Special attention to the most active research topics in topological condensed matter: theory of topological insulators and Majorana fermions, topological classification of ""grand ten” symmetry classes, and topological quantum computation
Extensions of topology to further areas of condensed matter, such as photonic and mechanical systems, topological quantum walks, topology in fractionalized systems, driven or dissipative systems.
Simple thought experiments that rely on considerations of symmetry or continuity under adiabatic deformations
Computer simulations similar to those used in actual research will give a more detailed and visual understanding of the involved concepts
Dissecting research papers that teaches you to simply understand the idea even in the rather involved ones.

Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between. Diverse scholars have suggested dogs arose as trash scavengers or as hunters’ helpers.
