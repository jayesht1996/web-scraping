How are contracts formed? What makes a contract enforceable?

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation. 

We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.

This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. 

The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…
 
Ce cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.

What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?
Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations.
In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.

In this course, you will learn how programming languages make use of various data structures to hold this information.  For example, storing a list of values for countries.  You ill learn how C# provides a plethora of data structures from simple arrays to more complex structures that permit the use of “typing”. Generics is a concept that C# uses to allow the representation of objects in your data structures to apply “typing”, making it easier to work with specific data types.

Even though most programming languages today implement their own versions of sorting and searching algorithms, these examples still provide you with a solid foundation for understanding the logic behind these algorithms and can shed light on how to implement your own algorithms in later programs. Not to mention the fact that they are also some of the most common algorithms used in interviews for programming jobs.

The open-source programming language R has for a long time been popular (particularly in academia) for data processing and statistical analysis. Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.",04-May,1 Reviews,Seth Mottaghinejad,"Data Scientist

They have become a key tool for researchers who study the effects of treatments, exposures, and policies. By summarizing and communicating assumptions about the causal structure of a problem, causal diagrams have helped clarify apparent paradoxes, describe common biases, and identify adjustment variables. As a result, a sound understanding of causal diagrams is becoming increasingly important in many scientific disciplines.

The first part of this course is comprised of five lessons that introduce the theory of causal diagrams and describe its applications to causal inference. The fifth lesson provides a simple graphical description of the bias of conventional statistical methods for confounding adjustment in the presence of time-varying covariates. The second part of the course presents a series of case studies that highlight the practical applications of causal diagrams to real-world questions from the health and social sciences.

You will then learn how forces affect motion through Newton’s Laws, and how to understand and calculate several different forces, including gravitational, normal force, drag force, and friction force. The concept of energy will be covered, including kinetic energy, potential energy, and how they are affected by work. You will learn how to use the conservation of energy to solve motion problems. Finally, momentum, another “quantity of motion” will be described. You will learn how to calculate momentum, about its relationship to Newton’s laws, and how to use it to solve motion problems, including collisions.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.

This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.

While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.

This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.

“The Science of Parenting” addresses this confusion by moving beyond the chatter and opinion surrounding parenting, and by looking directly at the science. Parenting itself is far from a science. Nevertheless, scientists have conducted thousands of studies that can help parents – or future parents – make sensible, informed decisions.

One goal of this course will be to provide a survey of important scientific findings spanning a range of topics that are central to the lives of parents:

Ever wondered why farming for a mighty sword in a fantasy game feels entertaining and fun while filling out reporting documents – a seemingly similar repetitive activity – is incredibly boring? If so, you are not alone!

The vast field of Gamification applies techniques and patterns from fundamental mechanics of game design to non-game contexts in order to make business tasks more fun for a user. This can lead to increased efficiency and accuracy and even facilitate better health by reducing exhaustion.

However, there is one particular requirement that often becomes a hurdle for Gamification efforts: meeting accessibility requirements.

In this computer science course, we will investigate this use case closer and derive a new set of patterns that are representation-agnostic. You will learn the fundamentals of Gamification and accessibility, as well as lessons in game development and game design. We will take a look at popular digital games and draw patterns from their game design and game mechanics.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a better grasp on the problem at hand and learn patterns and techniques to deploy gamification in a broader and more abstract scope.

We then introduce statistical modeling and how it is applied to high-throughput data. In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data. Finally, we will discuss hierarchical models and empirical bayes along with some examples of how these are used in practice. We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation.

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.

Un espacio en el que su monarquía creó el primer imperio global de la Historia. Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.

Aunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.

Esta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.

La acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.

En nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor.
Adentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura.
Ofrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él.
Comparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana.

In the first act of William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, the Jewish moneylender Shylock proposes a “merry sport” to the merchant Antonio: he will lend Antonio the money he needs if Antonio agrees to let Shylock take a pound of his flesh should he default. Shylock calls this contract a “merry bond,” and Shakespeare’s First Folio calls the play a comedy. But what does Shylock want from the bond, and how merry does the play ultimately prove?

You will learn about the ‘availability pillar’ of global food security that lies at the heart of food production, applicable to both crops and animal production. This course will discuss why yields in some parts of the world are lagging behind and identify the agro-ecological drivers that shape the broad diversity of production systems. Also, key issues relating to the closing of yield gaps and the difference in visions of sustainability will be explored.

Ecodesign means integrating planning, urban design and the conservation of natural systems to produce a sustainable built and natural environment. Ecodesign can be implemented through normal business practices and the kinds of capital programs and regulations already in use in most communities. We will show you how ecodesign has already been used for exceptional projects in many cities and suburbs—from Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm to False Creek North in Vancouver to Battery Park City in Manhattan, as well as many smaller-scale examples that can be adopted in any community. Cities and suburbs built according to ecodesign principles can and should become normal, instead of just a few special examples, transforming urban development into desirable, lower-carbon, compact and walkable communities and business centers.",05-May,26 Reviews,Larry Beasley,"Distinguished Practice Professor of Planning

The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.

By considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.

Control technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.

Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field.

This is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. These courses use a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, motor control, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller.

A quoi servent nos poumons ? Quel est le lien entre l’oxygène et la vie ? Ces questions ouvrent un vaste champ de découvertes et de curiosités pour mieux comprendre la  respiration. Ce cours s’adresse à toute personne qui souhaite apprivoiser, s’approprier ou approfondir le fonctionnement de la respiration et des poumons, autrement dit la physiologie respiratoire humaine.
 
Plongés au cœur de l’université et de la pratique hospitalière, durant  sept semaines, vous côtoierez professeurs, professionnels de la santé, internes et étudiants de médecine. Vous y apprendrez des notions de niveau universitaire qui ont été sélectionnées et adaptées afin que toute personne intéressée puisse les comprendre et y donner du sens. Ainsi, nous aborderons des thèmes proches du monde qui vous entoure : la respiration lors d’un effort physique, en altitude, le rôle des polluants atmosphériques, l’asthme….
 
A chaque leçon, un expert abordera des domaines concrets et pratiques : comment apprécier l’oxygénation d’un patient, pourquoi lui administrer de l’oxygène, que signifie hyperventiler….
 
Ce cours vous fera entrer en profondeur dans un monde où l’atmosphère est faite d’anatomie humaine, de physique des volumes et des pressions, de gaz et de sang, d’oxygène et de CO2, de poumons et de tissus, de tabagisme et de bronchite chronique.
 
Au terme de ce cours, vous serez capables de
expliquer et décrire les principes d’oxygénation, de ventilation, de transport et de consommation d’oxygène, de diffusion de gaz entre l’air et le sang… par des schémas et par des calculs utilisant quelques formules fondamentales.
évaluer la quantité et la qualité de l’oxygénation d’un patient,
distinguer les situations normales de celles dites pathologiques.

Learners will be introduced to the narrative sources of Hamlet, the religious convictions that shaped how people in Renaissance England understood the afterlife, and the ways that Shakespeare’s Ghost would have thrilled and challenged its original audience. Learners will also be invited to share their own theatrical interpretations of Hamlet and to consider how the themes of death, mourning, and memory shape Shakespeare’s play as well as their own lives.

You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown.

We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku.

Here, citizens play an important role amidst governments, companies, NGOs and researchers in creating social, technological and political innovations for achieving sustainability.
Citizens can be co-creators of sustainable cities when they engage in city politics or in the design of the urban environment and its technologies and infrastructure. In addition, citizens influence and are influenced by the technologies and systems that they use every day. Sustainability is thus a result of the interplay between technology, policy and people’s daily lives. Understanding this interplay is essential for creating sustainable cities. In this MOOC, we zoom in on Amsterdam, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Nairobi, Kampala and Suzhou as living labs for exploring the dynamics of co-creation for sustainable cities worldwide.

The course provides an overview of remarkable scientific discoveries. First, In 1913 Bohr showed that the hydrogen line spectrum can be explained based on the nuclear model of the atom and quantum theory. Bohr model introduced the concept of energy levels for electrons in an atom and led to wave mechanics and a full understanding of chemical bonding.

We will then discuss how amino acids could be produced from methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen using electric discharge as a source of energy. Chromatographic separation of simple compounds will be demonstrated. The 1953 paper in Science by Miller will be the primary source material. Third, The central dogma in protein synthesis will be briefly described. The determination of the primary structure of insulin will be discussed using Sanger’s 1958 Nobel Lecture. Experimental techniques such as electrophoresis and mass spectrometry as well as X-ray crystallography will be highlighted.

We focus on the chemical principles of oxidation and reduction in photosynthesis. Calvin’s 1961 Nobel Lecture explains the role of enzymes involved in the dark reaction. How plant life and animal life are coupled by photosynthesis and respiration will be emphasized. Finally, Haber’s synthesis of ammonia is on top of the list among scientific discoveries that saved most lives. How Haber successfully selected the right process conditions and the catalyst will be described using his 1918 Nobel Lecture.

Choosing the right market for your innovation is the biggest, and trickiest, question for innovators. Research has shown that all too often entrepreneurs don’t spend enough time identifying and researching their market opportunities – instead they jump at the first opportunity that looks good, and fail to properly evaluate and leverage other opportunities. This common mistake often leads them to choose the wrong market or lock themselves into one specific direction.

In this course, you will learn how to set a promising strategy, by using a business tool called the Market Opportunity Navigator.

This tool offers an easy to apply framework to better identify, evaluate and focus on the right market opportunities.

It  encompasses three simple steps, with dedicated worksheets to guide you through the process:
Search broadly-  to generate your set of market opportunities
Assess deeply- to evaluate your options and compare their attractiveness
Strategize smartly- to focus on the most attractive opportunity while remaining agile",0/5,0 Reviews,Marc Gruber,"Prof. Dr.

Do you recall recent cases such as Philip Morris v Uruguay and Vattenfall v Germany?
In the aftermath of these high profile cases and in the context of the negotiation of new international investment agreements, like the CETA and the TPP, local populations, policy-makers and NGOs have come to realize the societal importance of international investment law. Passionate and sometimes ill-informed discussions have resulted from this realisation. They have focused on the features of international investment law, which has traditionally granted rights to foreign investors to foster States’ economic development. Central to these discussions are the issues of:
the balance between the protection of foreign investors and the right of host States to regulate in order to protect public welfare objectives;
the duties and obligations of foreign investors;
the promotion of sustainable development in international investment law;
the legitimacy of arbitration tribunals to decide on disputes between host States and foreign investors;
the coherence of arbitration practice.
discover the history of international investment law and understand the dynamics which shape its evolution;
learn the objectives of international investment law and the specific rights international investment agreements grant to foreign investors;
discover how those rights have been interpreted by arbitration tribunals;
master the features and functions of investor-state arbitration;
understand why international investment law and investor-state arbitration are currently the subject of criticism and be able to assess the soundness of this criticism;

Attraverso 12 tappe storico-teoriche sarai accompagnato in un viaggio nel sapere filosofico con la consapevolezza che, come ha scritto Pierre Bayle, non c’è setta filosofica, per quanto sconfitta e superata, che non sia pronta a ripresentarsi. E non c’è posizione teoretica, neppure il parmenidismo, che non possa ritrovare attualità addirittura mediatica. Il superamento storico non vuol dire “oblio”, né comporta mai un definitivo superamento teorico. Al massimo insegna che sbagliando si impara, o che altri imparano, e che nulla – nemmeno le dottrine che negano il divenire – ritorna mai come prima.
